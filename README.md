# AI Agent App Template (Bolt for JavaScript)

This Bolt for JavaScript template demonstrates how to build [AI Apps](https://docs.slack.dev/ai/) in Slack.

Models from [OpenAI](https://openai.com) are used and can be customized for prompts of all kinds.

## Setup

Before getting started, make sure you have a development workspace where you have permissions to install apps. If you donâ€™t have one setup, go ahead and [create one](https://slack.com/create).

### Developer Program

Join the [Slack Developer Program](https://api.slack.com/developer-program) for exclusive access to sandbox environments for building and testing your apps, tooling, and resources created to help you build and grow.

## Installation

### Using Slack CLI

Install the latest version of the Slack CLI for your operating system:

- [Slack CLI for macOS & Linux](https://docs.slack.dev/tools/slack-cli/guides/installing-the-slack-cli-for-mac-and-linux/)
- [Slack CLI for Windows](https://docs.slack.dev/tools/slack-cli/guides/installing-the-slack-cli-for-windows/)

You'll also need to log in if this is your first time using the Slack CLI.

```sh
slack login
```

#### Initializing the project

```sh
slack create bolt-js-assistant --template slack-samples/bolt-js-assistant-template
cd bolt-js-assistant
```

#### Creating the Slack app

```sh
slack install
```

#### Running the app

```sh
slack run
```

2. Choose the workspace you want to install the application to
3. Copy the contents of [manifest.json](./manifest.json) into the text box that says `*Paste your manifest code here*` (within the JSON tab) and click _Next_
4. Review the configuration and click _Create_
5. Click _Install to Workspace_ and _Allow_ on the screen that follows. You'll then be redirected to the App Configuration dashboard.

### Environment Variables

Before you can run the app, you'll need to store some environment variables.


1. Rename `.env.sample` to `.env`.
2. Open your apps setting page from [this list](https://api.slack.com/apps), click _OAuth & Permissions_ in the left hand menu, then copy the _Bot User OAuth Token_ into your `.env` file under `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`.
```zsh
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
```
3. Click _Basic Information_ from the left hand menu and follow the steps in the _App-Level Tokens_ section to create an app-level token with the `connections:write` scope. Copy that token into your `.env` as `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`.
```zsh
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=YOUR_SLACK_APP_TOKEN
```
4. Save your OpenAI key into `.env` under `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
```zsh
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPEN_API_KEY
```


### Local Project

```

### Linting

```zsh
# Run lint for code formatting and linting
npm run lint
```

## Project Structure

### `manifest.json`

`manifest.json` is a configuration for Slack apps. With a manifest, you can create an app with a pre-defined configuration, or adjust the configuration of an existing app.

### `app.js`

`app.js` is the entry point for the application and is the file you'll run to start the server. This project aims to keep this file as thin as possible, primarily using it as a way to route inbound requests.

### `/listeners`

Every incoming request is routed to a "listener". This directory groups each listener based on the Slack Platform feature used, so `/listeners/events` handles incoming events, `/listeners/shortcuts` would handle incoming [Shortcuts](https://docs.slack.dev/interactivity/implementing-shortcuts/) requests, and so on.

**`/listeners/assistant`**

Configures the new Slack Assistant features, providing a dedicated side panel UI for users to interact with the AI chatbot. This module includes:

- The `assistant_thread_started.js` file, which responds to new app threads with a list of suggested prompts.
- The `message.js` file, which responds to user messages sent to app threads or from the **Chat** and **History** tab with an LLM generated response.

### `ai/`
The `index.js` file handles the OpenAI API initialization and configuration.
