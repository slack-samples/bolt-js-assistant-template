# App Agent & Assistant Template (Bolt for JavaScript)

This Bolt for JavaScript template demonstrates how to build [Agents & Assistants](https://api.slack.com/docs/apps/ai) in Slack.

## Setup
Before getting started, make sure you have a development workspace where you have permissions to install apps. If you donâ€™t have one setup, go ahead and [create one](https://slack.com/create).

### Developer Program
Join the [Slack Developer Program](https://api.slack.com/developer-program) for exclusive access to sandbox environments for building and testing your apps, tooling, and resources created to help you build and grow.


## Installation

### Create a Slack App

1. Open [https://api.slack.com/apps/new](https://api.slack.com/apps/new) and
   choose "From an app manifest"
2. Choose the workspace you want to install the application to
3. Copy the contents of [manifest.json](./manifest.json) into the text box that
   says `*Paste your manifest code here*` (within the JSON tab) and click _Next_
4. Review the configuration and click _Create_
5. You'll then be redirected to App Settings. Visit the **Install App** page and install your app.

### Environment Variables

Before you can run the app, you'll need to store some environment variables.

1. Rename `.env.sample` to `.env`
2. Open your apps setting page from
   [this list](https://api.slack.com/apps), click _OAuth & Permissions_ in the
   left hand menu, then copy the _Bot User OAuth Token_ into your `.env` file
   under `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
3. Click _Basic Information_ from the left hand menu and follow the steps in the
   _App-Level Tokens_ section to create an app-level token with the
   `connections:write` scope. Copy that token into your `.env` as
   `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`.

### Local Project

```zsh
# Clone this project onto your machine
git clone https://github.com/slack-samples/bolt-js-assistant-template.git

# Change into this project directory
cd bolt-js-assistant-template

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run Bolt server
npm start
```

### Linting

Run ESLint for code formatting and linting:

```zsh
npm run lint
```

## Project Structure

### `manifest.json`

`manifest.json` is a configuration for Slack apps. With a manifest, you can create an app with a pre-defined configuration, or adjust the configuration of an existing app.

### `app.js`

`app.js` is the entry point for the application and is the file you'll run to start the server. This project aims to keep this file as thin as possible, primarily using it as a way to route inbound requests.

## App Distribution / OAuth

Only implement OAuth if you plan to distribute your application across multiple workspaces. A separate `app-oauth.js` file can be found with relevant OAuth settings.

When using OAuth, Slack requires a public URL where it can send requests. In this template app, we've used [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/download). Checkout [this guide](https://ngrok.com/docs#getting-started-expose) for setting it up.

Start `ngrok` to access the app on an external network and create a redirect URL for OAuth. 

```
ngrok http 3000
```

This output should include a forwarding address for `http` and `https` (we'll use `https`). It should look something like the following:

```
Forwarding   https://3cb89939.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3000
```

Navigate to **OAuth & Permissions** in your app configuration and click **Add a Redirect URL**. The redirect URL should be set to your `ngrok` forwarding address with the `slack/oauth_redirect` path appended. For example:

```
https://3cb89939.ngrok.io/slack/oauth_redirect
```
